An assert is a "sanitary check". It
can take an instruction as an argument and throw
an exception if False is returned.

The assert statement allows the programmer to insert
statements into the code that automatically terminate
execution if the statement is false. In the
example above, the statement verifies that the final price will not
become negative and will not exceed the initial one.
